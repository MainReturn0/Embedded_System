# C Programming Projects

This directory contains C programming projects and assignments for embedded systems coursework.

## Projects

Projects will be organized in subdirectories. Each project folder will contain:
- Source code (`.c` files)
- Header files (`.h` files)
- Makefile (if applicable)
- Project-specific documentation

## Compilation

Most projects can be compiled using GCC:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c99 -o program_name source_file.c
```

For embedded targets, specific cross-compilers may be used (e.g., arm-none-eabi-gcc).

## Topics Covered

- Embedded C fundamentals
- Hardware interfacing
- Memory management
- Real-time programming
- Microcontroller programming
- Device drivers

*Projects will be added as coursework progresses.*
