## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a collection of my academic work in:
- **C Programming**: Low-level system programming, embedded applications
- **C++ Programming**: Object-oriented embedded systems development
- **Assembly Language**: Direct hardware manipulation and optimization

## 🛠️ Technologies

- C (C99/C11)
- C++ (C++11/C++14/C++17)
- Assembly (x86, ARM, or other architectures as specified in each project)

## 📝 Usage

Each subdirectory contains its own projects with relevant documentation. Navigate to specific folders for:
- Source code files
- Compilation instructions
- Project-specific README files (where applicable)

## 🔧 Building Projects

Building instructions vary by project. Generally:

**For C projects:**
```bash
cd C/<project_name>
gcc -o output_file source_file.c
```

**For C++ projects:**
```bash
cd CPP/<project_name>
g++ -o output_file source_file.cpp
```

**For Assembly projects:**
```bash
cd Assembly/<project_name>
nasm -f elf64 source_file.asm -o output_file.o
ld output_file.o -o output_file
```

## 📚 Academic Context

These projects were developed as part of my university coursework in Embedded Systems and Computer Engineering.
